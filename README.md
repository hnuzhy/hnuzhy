### Hi! Dear Visitor. :smiley: I'm Huayi Zhou, a PostDoc at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.

- :heart: I'm doing my research of Computer Vision, Pose Estimation, Transfer Learning and Digital Education. See [CV_DL_Gather](https://github.com/hnuzhy/CV_DL_Gather)
- :star: I'm a faithful follower of YOLO series algorithms for the simple yet efficient design. See [SSDA-YOLO](https://github.com/hnuzhy/SSDA-YOLO), [DirectMHP](https://github.com/hnuzhy/DirectMHP) and [BPJDet](https://github.com/hnuzhy/BPJDet)
- :thumbsup: I'm recently focusing on the semi-supervised learning (SSL) for its data/label efficient feature. See [MultiAugs](https://github.com/hnuzhy/MultiAugs), [SemiUHPE](https://github.com/hnuzhy/SemiUHPE)
- :rocket: I'm exploring the integration of SOTA vision methods with Embodied Robotic Manipulation. See [RobotManipulation](https://github.com/hnuzhy/RobotManipulation), [YOTO](https://github.com/hnuzhy/YOTO)

<!--
- :rocket: I'm exploring the practical and landable applications of advanced AI algorithms in the traditional classroom. See [StuArt](https://github.com/hnuzhy/StuArt)
